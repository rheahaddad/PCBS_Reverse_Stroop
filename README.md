# PCBS_Reverse_Stroop

It is a variant of the Stroop task. The participants are shown a word (the name of a color) in either the same color or a different one. Around the word are 4 squares: one is the color of the word, one is the color of written color, and the 2 remaining squares are random colors. The participant has to point to the color square of the written color. I will vary the congruence of the word in the middle, and the task of the participant (point to the color of the word or to the written color). The participant will use the mouse to point to and click on the corresponding color square. I will collect Hits, Misses, False Alarms, and Correct Rejections in a separate data file, in addition to RTs and information about the trial (congruent vs incongruent, written word vs color of the word).
